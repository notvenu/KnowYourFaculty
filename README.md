## 🎨 Design System

### Color Themes

The app supports light and dark themes with CSS custom properties:

- **Light Theme** — Clean whites with sky blue accents
- **Dark Theme** — Deep slate backgrounds with cyan accents
- **Tier Colors** — Green (Rod-God) → Orange (Rod) → Yellow (Moderate) → Lime (Loose) → Green (Loose-Good)

### Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: `<640px`
- Tablet: `640px - 1024px`
- Desktop: `>1024px`

## 🚢 Build & Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Generates optimized bundle in `dist/` directory with:

- Code splitting and tree-shaking
- Minification and compression
- Lazy-loaded route components
- Asset optimization

### Deployment (Vercel)

The project is configured for Vercel with:

**Security Headers** (`vercel.json`):

- HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy

**Cache Policy**:

- Static assets: `max-age=31536000, immutable`
- HTML: No cache for dynamic routing

### SEO Configuration

**Meta Tags** (`index.html`):

- Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- Twitter Card integration
- Canonical URL
- Structured metadata (description, keywords, author)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### User Privacy

- **Anonymous Reviews** — All feedback is publicly anonymous
- **Verified Students** — Login required only for identity verification
- **Account Deletion** — 24-hour grace period with instant delete option
- **Data Control** — Users can edit/delete their own reviews

### Content Moderation

- **Multilingual Filter** — Blocks offensive content in 8+ languages
- **Real-time Validation** — Reviews checked before submission
- **Unicode Support** — Proper handling of non-Latin scripts

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Empty Data / 401 Errors**

- Verify Appwrite project ID and database IDs in `.env`
- Check collection permissions (read: anyone, write: users)
- Confirm API token has required scopes

**Build Failures**

- Clear `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be 18+)
- Verify all environment variables are set

**Route 404 Errors**

- Ensure `vercel.json` rewrites are configured
- Check React Router routes in `src/App.jsx`
- Verify lazy-loaded imports resolve correctly

**Theme Not Switching**

- Check `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` element
- Verify CSS custom properties in `src/index.css`
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh

## 📝 Development Notes

- **Code Splitting** — All routes are lazy-loaded in `src/App.jsx`
- **State Management** — Redux Toolkit slices in `src/store/`
- **API Services** — Centralized in `src/services/` for reusability
- **Type Safety** — PropTypes validation on key components
- **Performance** — useMemo/useCallback for expensive operations
- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels and semantic HTML throughout
